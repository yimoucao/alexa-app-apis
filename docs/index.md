Welcome to Alexa Private APIs

All the apis are crawled from the [Alexa Web app](https://alexa.amazon.com).

These APIs may change at any time. We will keep these APIs updated as possible as we can.

These APIs are invoked from personal alexa account, users must login [Alexa](https://alexa.amazon.com) to gain access. Various web automation tools can be utilized for this purpose.
